# Algorithm Visualization App

## Introduction

Welcome to the Algorithm Visualization App! This Flutter project is designed to help you understand and visualize various graph traversal algorithms, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), A\*, and more.

## Features

-   **BFS Visualization:** Watch the Breadth-First Search algorithm in action as it explores a graph.

-   **A\* Algorithm:** Visualize the A\* algorithm, a popular pathfinding algorithm, as it finds the optimal path from the start to the goal.

-   **Graph Creation:** Create custom graphs to test and visualize different scenarios.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithm-visualization-app.git
    cd algorithm-visualization-app
    ```
