    assets:
        - assets/images/qrCodeL.png
        - assets/images/qrCodeD.png

    # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
    # assets:
    #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
    #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    # fonts:
    #   - family: Schyler
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
    #         style: italic
    #   - family: Trajan Pro
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
    #         weight: 700
    fonts:
        - family: AdventoPro
          fonts:
              - asset: assets/fonts/adventoPro/AdventPro-Regular.ttf
                style: normal
        - family: Play
          fonts:
              - asset: assets/fonts/play/play.ttf
                style: normal
        - family: Consolas
          fonts:
              - asset: assets/fonts/consolas/consolas.ttf
                style: normal
